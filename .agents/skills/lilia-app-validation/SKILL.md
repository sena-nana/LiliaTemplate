# Lilia App Validation

## Choose The Smallest Meaningful Check

Run checks that validate real behavior affected by the change. Prefer targeted functional checks over broad or brittle assertions.

- Always consider `yarn agent:debug --json` when app boundaries, important files, or recommended checks may have changed.
- Use `yarn test` for route behavior, command wiring, component behavior, config synchronization expectations, and business logic.
- Use `yarn build` for frontend compile, bundling, route import, and type integration risk.
- Use `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for app-owned Rust changes.
- Use `yarn verify` for broader final confidence when the change crosses frontend, Tauri, config, or build boundaries.

## Test Quality

- Add tests only for behavior changes or meaningful regression risk.
- Do not add tests for documentation-only, comment-only, or formatting-only changes.
- Do not write low-value tests that only hard-match log text, incidental strings, implementation comments, or snapshot-like markup.
- Test user-visible behavior, command results, route outcomes, config synchronization, permission availability, or data-contract handling.
- Keep tests focused on the changed capability and existing public behavior.

## LiliaUI Dependency Changes

When a final app consumes a changed LiliaUI package:

- Validate LiliaUI in its source repository first: use `yarn typecheck` and `yarn test` for package or UI changes.
- For `tauri-plugin-lilia`, run `cargo test -p tauri-plugin-lilia` in LiliaUI.
- After refreshing the final app dependency or lockfile, run at least `yarn agent:debug --json`, `yarn test`, and any affected build or Tauri check.

## Reporting

- State exactly which checks ran and whether they passed.
- If a check was skipped, explain why it was not necessary for the change.
- If a check cannot run, include the blocking error and remaining risk.
- Do not treat unrelated full-suite failures as blockers without confirming they touch the edited surface.
